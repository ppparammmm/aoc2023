About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released. Participants can solve these puzzles in any programming language of their choice. It’s a fun way to challenge your coding skills and learn new concepts.

Example Usage
Here is an example of how to use the utility functions to calculate the total calibration value:

python
Copy code
from utils.calculate_total_calibration import calculate_total_calibration

# Read input from file
file_path = 'day01/input.txt'
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    input_lines = file.readlines()

# Calculate the total calibration value
total_calibration_value = calculate_total_calibration(input_lines)
print(f"Total Calibration Value: {total_calibration_value}")
